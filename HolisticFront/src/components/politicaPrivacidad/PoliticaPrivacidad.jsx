        <p>Legal basis of processing</p>
        <p>
          The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the
          following applies:
        </p>

        <p>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</p>
        <p>
          Provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
          with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
        </p>
        <p>
          Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
          which the Owner is subject;
        </p>
        <p>
          Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
          interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
        </p>
        <p>
          Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
          pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal
          basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
          provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement,
          or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
        </p>
        <p>Further information about retention time</p>
        <p>
          Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be
          processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have
          been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable
          legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <p>
          Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a
          contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such
          contract has been fully performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate
          interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such
          purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate
          interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this
          document or by contacting the Owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period
          whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as
          such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged
          to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to
          fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
          Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to
          rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
          after expiration of the retention period.
        </p>

          (GDPR)

          processing of their Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object to processing of their Data. Users have the right to object to
          the processing of their Data if the processing is carried out on a
          legal basis other than consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access their Data. Users have the right to learn if Data is being

          Restrict the processing of their Data. Users have the right to
          restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will

        <p>
          Lodge a complaint. Users have the right to bring a claim before their
          competent data protection authority.
        </p>
        <p>

          transfers abroad including to any international organization governed
          by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such

          safeguard their Data.
        </p>
        <p>Details about the right to object to processing</p>
        <p>
          Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the
          exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the
          purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may
          object to such processing by providing a ground related to their
          particular situation to justify the objection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed
          for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at
          any time, free of charge and without providing any justification.
          Where the User objects to processing for direct marketing purposes,
          the Personal Data will no longer be processed for such purposes. To
          learn whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct
          marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this
          document.
        </p>
        <p>How to exercise these rights</p>

          are free of charge and will be answered by the Owner as early as
          possible and always within one month, providing Users with the

          Data or restriction of processing will be communicated by the Owner to
          each recipient, if any, to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed
          unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. At
